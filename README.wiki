GitHub has no web GUI to let users upload binary files to repositories.

This is a tiny django app that uses the GitHub API v3 and OAuth2 to let members of a GitHub 
organization push binary files like images to a specific directory in a GitHub repository.

== Features ==
* Preview before upload.
* Makes miniatures of uploaded images on request.
* Does not allow delete or overwrite.

== Requirements ==
* HTTPS capable webserver.
* Python2 >= v2.7
* Python modules: django, requests and pillow.

== Installation ==
* Install dependencies.
* Configure webserver to serve this app over https.
* Create local_settings.py in a dir outside of the repo, on PYTHONPATH, inaccessible to outsiders.
* Edit settings.py. Keep all secrets and local config to local_settings.py.
